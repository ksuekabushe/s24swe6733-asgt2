Group Assignment for SWE 6733 Spring 2024

Gilded Rose is a small inn with and it has inventory of items that needs to update with its quality as it goes with sell in date. This mob programming is to learn how to refactor this code with testing.
For this Assignment we have used following tools,

# Tools
1. Teams - Communication tool for screen sharing and recording our session. We used this tool throughout the assignment to share our work in progress status and updates.
2. Visual Studio - We used visual studio as IDE for programming the code solution
3. Github - We used Github as our code repository
4. Python - We choose python as our programming language

# Video recordings of mob programming
This video recordings covers multiple sessions in which we brainstormed which programming language to use and how it works. We discussed the requirement and development strategy and test scenarios.
We refactored our code during the session and made changes to it and ran multiple tests and reduced as much code smells.
